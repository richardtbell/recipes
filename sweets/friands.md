##Notes

I (Steph) make these whenever I get an opportunity. Something about them being mainly nuts is comforting, but quickly smothered by the sheer amount of butter. 

##Difficulty

Easy

##Serves

12 ish

##Ingredients

125g unsalted butter, melted, plus an extra 20g for brushing the tin
60g plain flour plus extra for dusting
60g blanched almonds
50g unsalted pistachios plus 1tbs chopped to garnish
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
200g caster sugar
grated zest of 1 lemon
1tbsp mashed banana
3 egg whites (100g)
120g fresh (or frozen then defrosted) berries tossed in flour (I tend to use blackberries and chop them in half, but you can use blueberries or raspberries all the same)
salt

Lemon glaze (optional)
50ml lemon juice
200g caster sugar

##Method

Preheat the oven to 200 C / 180 C Fan / Gas Mark 6. 

Place a 12 hole muffin tray in the freezer for 10 minutes. Melt the 20g of butter before brushing it generously over the tin moulds and dusting with flour. Place a dircle of greaseproof paper at the bottom of each mould to prevent the cakes sticking to the tin and return to the freezer. 

Put the nuts, flour, cinnamon and all except 2 tablespoonds of the sugar into a food processor. Work to a coarse, breadcrumb-like texture. Tip the nut mixture into a mixing bowl and add the melted butter, lemon zest and mashed banana. Stir to combine.

... (do your best not to eat the mixture right now. It is very delicious at this stage but if you snaffle it all now you'll have nothing to bake!)

Whisk the egg whites with 1/8 teaspoon of salt and the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar until the whites form soft peaks; around 6 minutes with an electric whisk. Gently fold into the nut and banana mixture. Once incorporated, gently fold in another third, along with the berries. Finally, fold in the remainder of the egg whites. 

Pour the batter into the muffin tins so that it comes two thirds of the way up the sides. Place in the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes until a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove from the oven and leave to cool. To un-mould, run a sharp knife along the edges of the friands and gently tip the tin over. 

Once the friands have cooled, make the glaze, if using. Whisk together the lemon juice and icing sugar in a small bowl, adding more lemon juice or sugar if needed to make a thick yet easily pourable glaze. Spoon it liberally over the friands (not your friends) letting the icing drip down the sides. Sprinkle with the chopped pistachios and put a couple of berries on top if you have them to spare. 


##Storage

They probably won't last long - we eat them really quickly. If you are partial to restraint, stick them in an airtight box.
