##Notes
These are typically weekend grub as they're not the fasted to make. But mama mia are they worth it...

##Difficulty

Easy

##Serves

6 pancakes (about 2 moderately hungry people)

##Ingredients

1 ripe banana, mashed
25g ground flaxseed
2 tbsp almond butter
2 eggs
2 tbsp maple syrup
1 tbsp vanilla bean paste
1 tsp ground cinnnamon
a pinch of salt
3 tbsp conconut oil


##Method

Combine all the ingredients except the coconut oil in a large bowl and mix thoroughly until smooth. Taste and add more maple syrup or cinnamon if you're that way inclined. 

Melt a little of the coconut oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Pour the mixture into small pancakes and cook for 2-3 minutes; when lots of bubbles start to appear on the surface of the pancakes; flip them over and cook for a further minute or two until golden. 

Transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper while you cook the rest. Then eat!


##Goes well with

More bananas and syrup, or bacon. 

##Storage

Just eat them up whilst they are good. We've never tried to store them!
