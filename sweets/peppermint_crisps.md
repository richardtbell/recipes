#Peppermint Crisps

##Source
Richard Bell's Brain

##Notes
Adding the chopped chocolate to the melted chocolate is important to temper the chocolate.

##Difficulty
Easy if you pay attention. Careful not to allow the sugar to over heat, or crystalise. Also be careful not to burn the chocolate or let any water get into it. But so long as nothing goes wrong, it's pretty simple.

##Serves
This will make 24 of the peppermint crisps that are contained in this little package
(The mint sugar will make about 16 tablespoons, but you can keep this in an air tight jar and keep for a while. Or you could do what we do and make hundreds to give away/eat)


##Ingredients

2 tablespoons mint sugar (see below)
1 teaspoon peppermint extract
100g plain/dark chocolate

###Mint sugar

200g granulated sugar
240ml water
1 teaspoon peppermint extract


##Method

###Mint sugar

Add water and sugar to a saucepan
Heat until you get to “Soft crack” temperature (140C), stirring all the while
Remove from the heat and add 1 teaspoon peppermint extract
Mix well and pour out onto some baking paper, spreading it so it is quite thin
Let it solidify and cool
Break into chunks and add to a food processor
Blitz in the food processor until you get small chunks of mint sugar, about 2mm in size

###Peppermint Crisps

Chop 70g of chocolate into small chunks
Add to double boiler until melted
Meanwhile chop 30g of chocolate into small chunks
When the chocolate has melted, take off the heat and add the additional 30g
Push the unmelted chocolate below the surface and leave for a minute
Stir and work the chocolate until it is all melted
Add 1 teaspoon peppermint extract
Add 2 tablespoons of the mint sugar
Mix well and add to piping bag
Pipe into moulds, trying to keep the top as flat as possible


##Storage
Keep them in a cool dry place, but not in the fridge.
