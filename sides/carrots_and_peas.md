#Carrot and peas


##Source 

Ottolenghi - The Cookbook (page 87)


##Notes

Like the French beans and mangetout, the key here is to undercook the veg so that they maintain their bite and vibrant colour


##Difficulty

Easy


##Serves

6


##Ingredients

130ml orange juice (it's worth using freshly squeezed oranges)
60ml red wine
50g honey
2 cinnamon sticks
4 star anise
1 1/2 teaspoon coriander seeds
1kg carrots, peeled and cut on an angle into 1cm-thick slices
90ml olive oil
3 garlic cloves, crushed
450g podded peas, fresh or frozen
75g pea shoots (or lamb's lettuce, as an alternative)
salt and black pepper


##Method

Start with the sweet sauce for roasting the carrots.
Pour the orange juice, wine and honet into a saucepan, add the cinnamon and star anise and bring to a simmer
Cook gently, uncovered, for 20 - 40 minutes, until reduced to about a third. 
Set aside.

Preheat oven to 250C/230C fan/Gas mark 9.
Heat a small frying pan, add the coriander seeds and dry toast them over a high heat for about 3 minutes. There should be a lot more fragrance coming from the seeds.
Put the seads in a bowl and mix with the carrots, olive oil, garlic and some salt and pepper
Spread the mixture out on a large baking tray and put in the oven.
After about 15 minutes (the carrots should have taken on some serious colour by now), remove the tray carefully, add the sweet sauce (including the cinnamon and star anise), stir well and return to the oven for about 7 minutes, until the carrots are cooked through but still have a bit of a bite.
Remove from the oven and allow them to cool

Throw the peas into a pot containing plenty of boiling salted water and simmer for a minute
Drain at once into a colander, run under a cold tap to stop the cooking and leave to drain thoroughly

Before serving, gently stir together the carrots and peas.
taste and add more salt and pepper if you like.
Dot with the pea shoots as you pile the vegetables onto a serving plate
