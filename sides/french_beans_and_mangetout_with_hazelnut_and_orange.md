##Notes

It's important to not over cook the beans. You want to have the vibrant green colour and flavour


##Difficulty

Easy


##Serves

6


##Ingredients

400g French beans
400g mangetout
70g unskinned hazelnuts
1 orange
20g chives, roughly chopped
1 garlic clove, chrushed
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons hazelnut oil
flaky sea salt and black pepper


##Method

Preheat oven to 200C/180C fan/Gas mark 6.
Trim the ends off the French beans and mangetout, keeping the two separate.
Bring plenty of unsalted water to the boil in a large saucepan - you need lots of space for the beans, as this is crucial for preserving their colour
Blanch the French beans in the water for 4 minutes, then drain into a colander and run them under plenty of tap water until cold
Leave to drain and dry
Repeat with the mangetout but blanch for only 1 minute

While the beans are cooking, scatter the hazelnits over a baking tray and roast in the oven for 10 minutes
Leave them until cool enough to handle, then rub them in a clean tea towel to remove the skin
Roughly chop the nuts, some can even stay whole

Using a vegetable peeler, remove the zest from the orange in strips, being careful to avoid the bitter white pith.
Slice each piece of zest into very thin strips

To assemble the dish, mix all the ingredients together in a bowl, toss gently then taste and adjust the seasoning with some flaky sea salt and black pepper.
Serve at room temperature
