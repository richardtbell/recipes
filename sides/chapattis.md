#Chapattis


##Source 

Own recipe


##Notes

The time you spend kneading the dough is paid off in the texture and the flavour


##Difficulty

Easy


##Serves

4


##Ingredients

125g Wholemeal flour (preferably bread flour)
125g plain flour (preferably bread flour)
175ml warm water
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon salt


##Method

Combine all the dry ingredients in a bowl
Add the olive oil
Mix well to distribute the oil throughout the dough
Add the water slowly, while mixing with your hands. Keep adding water until all of the flour has been combined into a dough.
At this point you should have a dough that is not sticky and is quite firm
Knead the dough until it softens and becomes smooth, pliable and elastic. This will take about 5 - 10 minutes of firm kneading. 
Once you're happy with the consistency of your dough, take about a tenth of the dough and roll it into a ball.
On a floured surface, roll the ball as flat as you can get it. The dough will spring back when stretched, but work it as thin as you can and set aside.
Repeat this for the rest of the dough.
Heat a pan on a medium - high heat and add a little oil/butter.
While the pan heats up, grab one of your chapattis and give it a final stretch, then put it on the pan.
After about 30 seconds, flip the chapatti and cook the other side. It's cooked enough when it starts to get brown spots.
Repeat for the rest of your chapattis.
