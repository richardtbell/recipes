2 tablespoons sunflower oil
2 medium onions thinly sliced
12 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
4 large plum tomatoes, cut length-ways into 8 long wedges
4 long cinnamon sticks
1 tablespoon pink peppercorns
2 whole dried chipotle chillies, deseeded
100ml brandy
500ml white wine
500ml chicken stock
40g dark chocolate, roughly broken
100g ghee, melted
250g filo pastry
20g icing sugar
coarse sea salt and black pepper

###Catalan spinach
100ml Valdespino Sherry vinegar (or another good quality sherry vinegar)
100ml brandy
100g currants
150g pine nuts, toasted
1.5 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
3 small shallots, thinly sliced
2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
200ml double cream
300g baby spinach


##Method

Season the chicken pieces with 1.5 teaspoons salt and a good grind of black pepper.
heat the sunflower oil in a large saute pan and place on a high heat.

Add half the chicken pieces and sear for 7-8 minutes, turning once half way through, until deep golden brown on both sides.
remove from the pan and set aside to cool whilst you continue with the remaining batch.
keep the pan on a high heat and add the onions and garlic.
Cook on a medium-high heat for 15-18 minutes, until the onions are soft, dark, and caramelised like jam.
Keep a close eye on it towards the end and stir constantly, to make sure it does not catch on the bottom of the pan.
Add the tomatoes, cinnamon, peppercorn and dried chillies along with half a teaspoon of salt.
Continue to cook for another 4-5 minutes, stirring from time to time, then slowly pour over the brandy.
Cook for a further two minutes, then return the chicken pieces to the pan.
Pour over the wine and stock, reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered for one hour.
Remove the chicken pieces, increase the heat and let the sauce bubble away for 30-35 minutes, until it has reduced by a quarter and has the consistency of caramel.
Remove and discard the cinnamon stick and chillies, add the chocolate and cook for 2 minutes, stirring often Remove from the heat and set aside to cool: you should have about 500ml in the pan.

Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, use your hands to pick all the meat off the bones.
Return the meat to the sauce, stir gently and set aside.

To make the catalan spinach, pour the sherry vinegar and brandy into a small saucepan and place on a medium-low heat.
Warm through for five minutes then remove from the heat.
Stir through the currants and set aside to cool.
Mix the pine nuts with 1 tsp of oil and the paprika and set aside.
Pour the remaining oil into a very large saute pan, place on a medium-low heat and add the shallots.
Cook for about 8 minutes, until soft and lightly coloured.
Add the garlic, along with 1 tsp of salt, and cook for a further 2 minutes, Add the currant and brandy mix, along with the pine nuts, and cook for 2 more minutes.
Pour in the cream, increase the heat and cook for 3 minutes, to reduce the sauce by a quarter.
Stir in the spinach and cook for 3-4 minutes, uncovered, for the leaves to wilt and for the liquid to evaporate so that there is about 2 tbsp left in the pan.

Preheat the oven to 200 C / 180 C fan / gas mark 6.

Brush the base and the sides of a large, deep oven-proof, saute pan / around 25cm wide and 8 cm deep / with about a tablespoon of the melted ghee.
Brush the first sheet of filo pastry and line the base of the pan.
Continue with the next sheet, generously overlapping as you go, and leaving about an 8cm overhang over the edge of the pan with each sheet.
Work quite quickly here, so that the pastry does not dry out, brushing each sheet liberally with the melted ghee.
Continue until you have used 2/3 of the pastry sheets, then spoon the spinach mixture into the base of the pan.
Spread the chicken on top, then continue with the remaining pastry sheets, tucking these ones into the pan as though making a bed with fitted sheets.
Continue until all the filo has been used before drawing in the overhanging pastry sheets and sealing these on top of the pie with a final brush of the melted ghee.


Place in the oven and cook for one hour, uncovered.
Cover with foil and cook for a final ten minutes, so that the bottom gets golden brown without the top burning.
Remove from the oven and set aside for 10 minutes before inverting the pastilla onto a platter.
Sprinkle over the icing sugar, through a fine mesh sieve, and serve warm as is.
You can also make a mesh pattern on top of the pastilla by heating up a metal skewer with a blow torch until red hot.
Create parallel lines by burning the sugar in straight lines, spaced 2cm apart and then repeating at a 90 degree angle.
