##Notes

If you get this right, it should be the best thing you've ever tasted.
The key to getting perfect crackling is to make sure that the wine doesn't touch the skin

##Time

Just over 3 hours


##Serves

4


##Ingredients

20g sprigs of thyme
12 large garlic cloves, skin left on but bruised with the flat side of a large knife
4 sticks of lemongrass, lightly bruised with a rolling pin
10cm piece of ginger (100g), unpeeled and cut into 1cm slices
1 piece of pork belly, weighing 1.5kg (try to get a piece that will perfectly fit the dish you're going to cook it in)
1 lemon, halved
60g coarse sea salt
500ml white wine


##Butternut squash

1 large butternut squash (1.5kg), peeled, de-seeded and cut into 2cm chunks
2 tablespoons olive oil
30g unsalted butter
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
3 tablespoon white miso paste


##Salsa
1 granny smith apple, unpeeled, quartered, cored and cut into 1cm dice
70g walnuts, toasted and lightly crushed
50g pickled walnuts, rinsed and cut into 1cm dice
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
2 tablespoon yuzu juice (or lime juice if unavailable)
1 tablespoon mirin
10g tarragon, finely chopped
3 tablespoon olive oil
coarse sea salt and black pepper


##Method

Preheat oven to 240C/220C fan/Gas mark 9
Spread the thyme garlic cloves, lemongrass and ginger over the base of a large high sided Roasting tray measuring 32cm x 24cm. 
Lay the pork belly on top of the herbs skin side up and use kitchen paper to pat the meat dry. 
Rub the lemon all over the pork skin squeezing the juice out as you rub.
Set aside to dry for 10 minutes before sprinkling half of the salt evenly all over the skin.
Place in the oven an roast for an hour until the crackling is semi hard and the salt has turned grey: the aromatics will be very crisp and charred at this point, but don't worry - this is normal.
Remove from the oven and scrape off and discard the salt
spread the remaining half of the salt all over the skin, then return it to the oven.
Cook for another half hour until the crackling is solid and hard.
remove the tray from the oven and reduce the oven temperature to 190C/ 170C fan / gas mark 5.
if a bubble has formed on the skin, insert a small knife and gently push it down to release the air.
Pour the wine into the roasting tray, taking care not to wet the sides or the skin of the pork belly, followed by 400ml of water.
Return the tray to the oven and cook for another hour.
reduce the heat to 120C / 100C fan/ gas mark 0.5 and cook for a final hour.
Remove from the oven and set aside to rest for 30 minutes.

While the pork is roasting for the last hour, prepare all the Ingredients for the butternut squash and the salsa, and as soon as it is out of the oven increase the oven temperature to 220C/200C fan/gas mark 7.
Mix the squash with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and spread it out on a large baking tray.
Roast in the oven for 30-40 minutes until cooked.
Transfer to a large bowl, add the butter and use a potato masher to crush the squash - don't over mash it, as you want some texture to remain - before stirring in the rice vinegar, miso and 1 tablespoon of salt and a grind of black pepper.
keep warm.
Mix together all the Ingredients for the salsa in a Medium bowl, along with 1/2 teaspoon of salt and a grind of black pepper
transfer the rested pork to a chopping board.
the liquid left in the baking tray can either be discarded - it's done it's work on the pork - or use as a base for a soup or a stew.
discard the herbs from the pork and use a metal spoon or a pastry brush to brush off any excess salt from the skin, then use a large serrated knife to slice the meat into evenly sized rectangles, 3-4cm thick.
If you want to remove the ribs before you slice the meat, you can pull and twist them out, otherwise you can slice between them and serve the meat on the ribs.
to serve, divide the warm crushed squash between the plates and place a slice of pork on top.
Spoon the salsa alongside or on the side and serve.
